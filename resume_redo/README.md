#Prime Academy Resume (redo)
###This is a folder for my Prime resume redo. I put it in a different folder so I could see my resume progress. Thanks for visiting!

##List of resume updates
+ **Almost no DIVS** It was cool to use the tags I learned in codeschool and put them to good use. The only DIVs I left in my source code were my temporary DIVS for media queries. I found it difficult to use Semantic elements in media queries so I left mine as is. I really miss my DIVS though :disappointed_relieved:
+ **Updated Navigation** I relocated the navigation so it goes into the main header now. I now know how to place an element anywhere on a webpage. I really liked how it turned out!
+ **New favicon** Looking at the boring old broken icon was getting old, so I decided to make a simple new one in photoshop. It adds a bit more charm to the page :grin:
+ li
+ **Added Google analytics!** I know it wasn't in this week's codeschool work, but I had never used it and wanted to put it in my resume (I know I have little to no audince to look at, but I still wanted to experiment using VPMs and other silly things with it)! I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.

If you find any page-breaking bugs, feel free to submit an issue. I only tested my page in Google Chrome, so I'm sure there are a few browser cross-compatibility issues. Thanks!
