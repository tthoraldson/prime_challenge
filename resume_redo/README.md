###This is a folder for my Prime resume redo. I put it in a different folder so I could see my resume progress. Thanks for visiting!

##List of resume updates
+ **No more DIVS** My previous web developer soul hurts. It was cool to use the tags I learned in codeschool and put them to good use. I really miss my DIVS though :'(
+ li

+ **Added Google analytics!** I know it wasn't in this week's codeschool work, but I had never used it and wanted to put it in my resume (I know I have little to no audince to look at, but I still wanted to experiment using VPMs and other silly things with it)! I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.

If you find any page-breaking bugs, feel free to submit an issue. I only tested my page in Google Chrome, so I'm sure there are a few browser cross-compatibility issues. Thanks!
